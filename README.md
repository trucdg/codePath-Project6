# WebDev Project 6 - Data Dashboard - Part II

## Submitted by: **Truc Duong**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Inspiration 
In [codePath-project5-part2](https://github.com/trucdg/codePath-project5-part2), I created the dashboard view of a dataset from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs).
This week, I will add some data visualizations to the dashboard view and then construct a detail view containing more information related to a given data point.
I'll implement dynamic links using React Router, giving each data point listed on my dashboard a unique link to a corresponding detail view.

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## üéØ Goals
By the end of this assignment I will be able to
- [ ] Use React Router to build navigation around the application
- [ ] Use `Link` to dynamically generate a list of routes
- [ ] Use `useParams()` hook to extract parameters from a URL
- [ ] Install and integrate an npm library into an existing React app

## üëÄ Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] **The app includes at least two unique chart developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story**
- [ ] **Clicking on an item in the list view displays more details about it**
- [ ] **Clicking on an item has a direct, unique link to that item's detail view page**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] The site's customized dashboard contains more content that explains what is interesting about the data
- [ ] The site allows users to toggle between different data visualizations

## Video Walkthrough
